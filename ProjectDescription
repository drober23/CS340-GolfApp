   * Lofts
   * Lies
   * Shafts
   * Grips
   * Distance ( yards / meters ) of each club
* Keep track of tendencies ( ie. slicing, hooking, missed putts, etc )
* Keep track of paces walked hence calories burned
* News feed on different tours where user specify ( PGA Tour, Web.com Tour, LPGA Tour, Golf Channel, etc. )
* Nearby course located around your locations ( ex. 15, 25, 50+ miles & may have to use GPS capabilities )
* Pro Tips for each hole on each course
   * According to your handicap, lets you know how you should play this hole ( shot-link tutorial )
   * Could possibly change this when user inputs a target score
