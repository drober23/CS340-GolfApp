CS340-GolfApp
=============

All files are in the 'GolfApp' file in the repo. It should run from there. 
However, make sure that the path to the database is correct in golfapp.db.

Two partners where working on a Windows computer and one was on a Mac. The team member on the Mac was able to move
past the login screen while the 2 members on the Windows weren't able to. We tried to troubleshoot this problem but 
didn't have any luck.

In the virtual scorecard section we were planning on having 6 tees per hole but there as miscommunication in our group and
we only have 3.

While making the database we first tried using a Microsoft Access database. We weren't able to link it to our code so we 
switched to a SQLite database.

Also, we had problems getting used to GitHub and committing things and having errors caused by not syncing correcting.
